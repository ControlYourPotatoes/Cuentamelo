# Cuentamelo Testing Framework Revamp Plan

## Overview

**Objective:** Modernize and expand the testing framework to comprehensively cover all new and legacy infrastructure, leveraging new mock services and best practices for test-driven, maintainable development.

---

## Current State Analysis

- **Legacy/Temp Tests:**
  - Many tests exist as scripts in `scripts/` (not pytest-based, not CI-friendly).
  - `tests/` directory has a solid structure but much of it references old infrastructure.
  - Some tests use outdated patterns, direct instantiation, or hardcoded dependencies.
- **New Infrastructure:**
  - **Command Broker**: Central command routing, persistence, and event emission.
  - **Frontend Service (N8N)**: New API endpoints, event bus, scenario management, user interaction, analytics.
  - **Dependency Injection**: All services now injectable, with mocks available for AI, news, frontend, agent factory, etc.
  - **Mocks**: New, but untested, for all major ports (AI, news, frontend, agent factory, analytics, etc.).

---

## Testing Principles & Rules

- **Test-Driven Design:** Write tests as behavior specs, test public interfaces, use DI/mocks, cover errors/edges.
- **Test Generation Strategy:** Pyramid: many fast unit tests, some integration, few E2E. Test behaviors, not implementation.
- **Testable Code Patterns:** Use DI, builder patterns, pure functions, ports/adapters.
- **Fast Feedback:** Unit tests must be fast, avoid real network/db unless integration/E2E.

---

## Revamp Goals

- **Modernize:** All tests should use pytest, fixtures, and the new dependency injection/mocks.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** All new infrastructure (command broker, frontend service, event bus, scenario/user interaction, analytics) must have unit and integration tests.
- **Mock Usage:** Only mock dependencies, never the system-under-test. Mocks must be validated to match real interfaces.
- **CI-Ready:** All tests runnable via pytest, with coverage and clear pass/fail.
- **Remove/Refactor Scripts:** Move all meaningful test logic from `scripts/` into proper pytest tests.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ **Mock Service Validation**: All mock services (AIProvider, NewsProvider, TwitterProvider, OrchestrationService) have been validated and fixed to match real interfaces.
- ✅ **Mock Implementation**: Implemented all required abstract methods in mocks:
  - `MockAIProvider`: Added `generate_response`, `analyze_sentiment`, `extract_entities`
  - `MockNewsProvider`: Added `get_latest_news`, `search_news`, `get_news_by_category`
  - `MockTwitterProvider`: Added `post_tweet`, `get_user_timeline`, `search_tweets`
  - `MockOrchestrationService`: Added `execute_workflow`, `get_workflow_status`
- ✅ **Import Issues Fixed**: Resolved all import issues in mock services and test files.
- ✅ **Test Fixtures Updated**: Updated fixtures to match actual model fields and method signatures.
- ✅ **Redis Client Mock**: Fixed Redis client mock to return proper async pubsub object with async methods.

### Phase 2: Unit Test Expansion ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ **Command Broker Service**: Complete test coverage (14/14 tests passing)
- ✅ **Frontend Event Bus**: Complete test coverage (15/15 tests passing)
- ✅ **Dependency Container**: Complete test coverage (25/25 tests passing)
- ✅ **N8N Frontend Service**: Complete test coverage (32/32 tests passing)
  - ✅ Fixed CharacterStatus model field mismatch (`character_id` vs `id`)
  - ✅ Fixed event bus error handling in error scenarios
  - ✅ Fixed dashboard flow integration issues
  - ✅ Fixed agent factory mock structure

### Phase 3: Integration & E2E Tests ⏳ PENDING

- ⏳ **Command Flow Integration**: Submit → execute → status
- ⏳ **Event Bus Integration**: Publish/subscribe, event propagation
- ⏳ **Scenario Management**: Create, execute, result
- ⏳ **User Interaction**: Simulate user/character chat
- ⏳ **Analytics**: Event tracking, summary generation

### Phase 4: Coverage, Performance, and CI ⏳ PENDING

- ⏳ **Coverage Analysis**: Target 90%+ coverage for all core logic
- ⏳ **Performance Tests**: Smoke tests for key endpoints and flows
- ⏳ **CI Integration**: Fast feedback pipeline
- ⏳ **Documentation**: Test structure, patterns, and guidelines

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Mocks drift from reality:** ✅ Regularly validate mocks against real implementations.
- **Legacy code untested:** 🔄 Prioritize refactoring old tests to new patterns.
- **Slow tests:** ✅ Isolate slow integration/E2E tests, keep unit tests fast.
- **Test flakiness:** ✅ Use deterministic data, avoid real network unless needed.
