**SSE Handler Module**
- Test SSE connection establishment and management
- Test event parsing and data extraction

### Integration Tests

**Dashboard-to-API Integration**
- Test complete workflow: news selection → character selection → analysis request
- Test SSE stream connection and real-time update reception
- Test custom news submission and analysis trigger
- Test error handling for API failures and timeouts

**Real-time Analysis Flow**
- Test analysis initiation with multiple characters selected
- Test streaming updates during character analysis process
- Test final results display with engagement decisions and reasoning
- Test concurrent analysis handling (multiple characters processing simultaneously)

**User Interface Integration**
- Test form validation preventing submission with incomplete data
- Test loading states during API calls and analysis processing
- Test error message display and recovery actions
- Test responsive design across desktop and tablet screen sizes

### Browser Compatibility Tests

**Cross-browser Functionality**
- Test core functionality in Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+
- Test SSE support with polling fallback for unsupported browsers
- Test CSS Grid/Flexbox layout consistency across browsers
- Test JavaScript ES6+ feature compatibility with polyfills

**Performance Tests**
- Test initial page load time under 200ms
- Test smooth animations and transitions at 60fps
- Test memory usage during extended analysis sessions
- Test SSE connection performance with multiple concurrent updates

### End-to-End Tests

**Complete Analysis Scenarios**
- Test scenario-based analysis: select predefined news → select characters → view results
- Test custom news analysis: input custom content → select characters → view streaming results
- Test multi-character comparison: analyze same content with different characters side-by-side
- Test error recovery: simulate network issues and verify graceful handling

**Presentation Mode Testing**
- Test professional presentation flow suitable for client demonstrations
- Test visual polish and smooth interactions during live presentations
- Test quick reset and scenario switching for demo purposes
- Test responsive behavior when resizing browser window during presentations

## Mocking Requirements

### API Response Mocking
- **Character Data**: Mock `/api/characters` responses with test character configurations
- **Scenario Data**: Mock `/api/scenarios` responses with sample news scenarios
- **Analysis Results**: Mock `/api/analyze-engagement` responses for predictable testing
- **SSE Streams**: Mock Server-Sent Events data for real-time update testing

### Network Condition Mocking
- **Slow Connections**: Simulate slow network to test loading states and timeouts
- **Connection Loss**: Mock network interruptions to test SSE reconnection logic
- **API Failures**: Mock various HTTP error responses (404, 500, timeout) for error handling
- **Partial Failures**: Mock scenarios where some characters succeed and others fail

### Time-based Mocking
- **Analysis Duration**: Mock variable analysis times to test progress indicators
- **SSE Timing**: Mock streaming update timing to test UI update throttling
- **Timeout Scenarios**: Mock long-running requests to test timeout handling
- **Connection Recovery**: Mock SSE reconnection timing for recovery testing

## Test Data Requirements

### Sample News Content
```javascript
// Predefined test scenarios
const testScenarios = [
  {
    id: 'sports-basketball',
    title: 'Vaqueros Championship Win',
    content: 'Los Vaqueros de Bayamón win basketball championship...'
  },
  {
    id: 'culture-festival',
    title: 'Festival de la Calle San Sebastián',
    content: 'Annual cultural festival brings thousands to Old San Juan...'
  },
  {
    id: 'politics-local',
    title: 'Mayoral Election Results',
    content: 'Local mayoral election results announced...'
  }
];
```

### Test Character Configurations
```javascript
// Mock character data for testing
const testCharacters = [
  {
    id: 'jovani',
    name: 'Jovani Vázquez',
    description: 'Cultural enthusiast and community organizer',
    avatar: '/assets/jovani-avatar.jpg'
  },
  {
    id: 'miguel',
    name: 'Miguel Rivera',
    description: 'Sports fan and local business owner',
    avatar: '/assets/miguel-avatar.jpg'
  }
];
```

### Expected Analysis Results
```javascript
// Mock analysis response structure
const mockAnalysisResult = {
  character_id: 'jovani',
  engagement_decision: 'engage',
  engagement_score: 0.85,
  reasoning: 'High cultural relevance and community impact',
  topic_analysis: {
    culture: 0.9,
    sports: 0.1,
    politics: 0.0
  },
  response_preview: 'What an incredible celebration of our culture...'
};
```
