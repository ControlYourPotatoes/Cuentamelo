## Overview

Implement a modern, responsive HTML dashboard that provides an intuitive interface for real-time AI character engagement analysis. This web interface allows users to select news content, choose characters for analysis, and observe the decision-making process in real-time with professional presentation quality suitable for client demonstrations.

## User Stories

### Demo Presenter Story

As a **demo presenter showcasing the platform to potential clients**, I want a polished web interface so that I can demonstrate character engagement decisions with smooth real-time updates and professional visual presentation.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Open dashboard at `/dashboard/interactive.html` during client presentation
2. Use dropdown to select from curated Puerto Rican news scenarios
3. Select characters via intuitive checkboxes with character avatars/descriptions
4. Click "Start Analysis" and watch real-time streaming results appear
5. Show engagement scores, reasoning, and decision outcomes side-by-side
6. Reset and demonstrate different scenarios to show personality consistency
7. Use custom news input to test client-specific content types

### Developer Testing Story

As a **developer testing character implementations**, I want a visual interface for debugging so that I can quickly see engagement decision patterns and identify personality logic issues during development.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Access dashboard during development for visual debugging
2. Input test news content and select specific characters to debug
3. Watch real-time decision process with detailed reasoning display
4. Compare multiple characters side-by-side to spot inconsistencies
5. Use error handling feedback to identify integration issues
6. Export or copy results for documentation and bug reports

### Cultural Consultant Story

As a **cultural consultant validating authenticity**, I want to test custom cultural content so that I can verify characters respond authentically to Puerto Rican cultural references and situations.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Input custom news about specific Puerto Rican cultural events
2. Test character responses for cultural accuracy and authenticity
3. Analyze language patterns and cultural references in responses
4. Identify any inauthentic or stereotypical response patterns
5. Document findings for personality refinement recommendations
