# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Interactive Demo Dashboard & CLI Enhancement
> Created: 2025-07-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement an interactive HTML dashboard and enhanced CLI system that allows granular control over AI character engagement testing. Users can select specific news articles, choose which characters should analyze them, and observe the engagement decision-making process in real-time, showcasing the sophisticated character intelligence and cultural authenticity of the platform.

## User Stories

### Demo Presenter Story

As a **demo presenter showcasing the platform to potential clients**, I want to interactively select news articles and characters so that I can demonstrate how different AI personalities make autonomous engagement decisions based on their cultural backgrounds, interests, and engagement thresholds.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Open interactive dashboard during client presentation
2. Select a Puerto Rican news article from dropdown (e.g., "Vaqueros win championship")
3. Check boxes for Jovani VÃ¡zquez and Miguel Rivera to test both personalities
4. Click "Start Analysis" and watch real-time decision-making process
5. Observe that Miguel engages passionately (basketball fan) while Jovani might focus on the celebration aspect
6. Show client the different response styles and cultural authenticity
7. Reset and try different news types to demonstrate personality consistency

### Developer Testing Story

As a **developer working on character personalities**, I want both CLI and web interfaces so that I can quickly test character engagement during development and debug personality logic without running full demo scenarios.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Use CLI for rapid testing during development: `python cli.py test-engagement --news "political announcement" --characters miguel --explain`
2. See detailed reasoning why Miguel decided not to engage (avoids heavy politics)
3. Adjust personality configuration and test again
4. Use HTML dashboard for visual debugging and comparing multiple characters side-by-side
5. Export results for personality tuning and documentation

### Cultural Consultant Story

As a **cultural consultant validating character authenticity**, I want to test how characters respond to specific cultural content so that I can ensure the AI personalities represent Puerto Rican culture accurately and consistently.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Input custom news about Puerto Rican cultural events, local politics, sports, and daily life
2. Test both characters against the same content to verify cultural authenticity
3. Analyze response patterns and language use for cultural consistency
4. Identify any responses that feel inauthentic or stereotypical
5. Provide feedback for personality refinement

## Spec Scope

1. **Interactive HTML Dashboard** - Modern web interface with news selection, character checkboxes, and real-time results display
2. **Enhanced CLI System** - Command-line tools for development workflow and automated testing  
3. **Character Engagement Analysis** - Real-time display of decision-making process and reasoning
4. **Multi-Character Comparison** - Side-by-side analysis of how different personalities respond to same content
5. **Custom News Input** - Ability to test characters against user-provided news content beyond predefined scenarios

## Out of Scope

- Real Twitter posting (this is for analysis and demonstration only)
- Character personality editing through the interface
- Historical data storage and analytics
- Advanced A/B testing features (reserved for future phases)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional HTML dashboard** accessible at `/dashboard` that demonstrates character engagement decisions with intuitive controls and real-time feedback
2. **Enhanced CLI commands** that provide the same functionality as the dashboard for development workflow integration
3. **Character decision transparency** showing engagement scores, topic analysis, and reasoning for each character's decision to engage or ignore content
