## Mocking Requirements

### External Services
- **Anthropic Claude API**: Mock AI responses for character analysis to ensure consistent test results
- **Redis Connection**: Mock Redis for session storage to enable testing without external dependencies
- **N8N Webhooks**: Mock webhook calls to isolate testing from external workflow systems

### Character Analysis Engine
- **Personality Config Loader**: Mock character configuration loading for testing different personality scenarios

## Performance Tests

### Load Testing
- Test dashboard with multiple concurrent users analyzing characters
- Test API endpoints under high request volume
- Test SSE connections with many simultaneous streams
- Test character analysis performance with complex personality configurations

### Response Time Tests

- Verify SSE events are delivered within 100ms of generation
- Verify CLI commands complete within 5 seconds

### Memory and Resource Tests
- Test session cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Test concurrent character analysis doesn't exceed resource limits

- Test character configuration caching effectiveness

## Security Tests

### Input Validation
- Test custom news content sanitization prevents script injection
