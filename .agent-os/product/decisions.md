## 2025-07-22: Initial Product Architecture Decisions

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Solo Developer, Product Owner

### Decision

Implement clean architecture with ports & adapters pattern for AI character orchestration platform targeting Puerto Rican social media engagement, using LangGraph for workflow management and FastAPI for API layer.

### Context

Building a sophisticated demo platform for a company developing AI tools for content creators requires demonstrating advanced engineering practices while maintaining cultural authenticity. The system needs to showcase autonomous AI character capabilities for social media engagement.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic Django Application**
   - Pros: Rapid development, built-in admin, ORM included
   - Cons: Tight coupling, harder to test AI workflows, less demonstrable architecture

2. **Node.js with Express**
   - Pros: JavaScript ecosystem, real-time capabilities
   - Cons: Less mature AI/ML libraries, weaker typing system

3. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Pros: Ultimate scalability, technology diversity
   - Cons: Excessive complexity for demo, deployment overhead

### Rationale

Chose Python with clean architecture because:
- Demonstrates sophisticated software engineering practices
- Python ecosystem excellence for AI/ML work
- Clean architecture enables comprehensive testing and maintainability
- Ports & adapters pattern shows understanding of enterprise patterns
- FastAPI provides modern, typed API development

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Highly testable and maintainable codebase
- Clear separation of concerns enabling future expansion
- Impressive technical demonstration for potential clients
- Flexible character system through dependency injection

**Negative:**
- Higher initial development time compared to monolithic approach
- More complex for simple features
- Requires discipline to maintain architectural boundaries

## 2025-07-22: Cultural Authenticity Over Generic AI

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Cultural Consultant

### Decision

Prioritize deep Puerto Rican cultural authenticity over broad character variety, implementing detailed cultural patterns, local expressions, and behavioral modeling specific to Puerto Rican personalities.

### Context

Generic AI chatbots fail to create meaningful engagement with local audiences. Authentic cultural representation requires deep knowledge of language patterns, cultural references, and social behaviors specific to Puerto Rico.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Spanish-Language Characters**
   - Pros: Broader market appeal, easier to implement
   - Cons: Lacks cultural authenticity, poor local engagement

2. **Multi-Cultural Character Set**
   - Pros: Wider target audience, diversified approach
   - Cons: Shallow cultural implementation, diluted expertise

### Rationale

Deep cultural authenticity creates:
- Genuine emotional connection with Puerto Rican audiences
- Differentiation from generic AI tools
- Demonstrable expertise in cultural AI development
- Foundation for expanding to other specific cultures

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Authentic engagement that resonates with target audience
- Clear competitive differentiation
- Demonstrable cultural expertise
- Foundation for cultural AI consulting services

**Negative:**
- Smaller initial target market
- Requires ongoing cultural research and validation
- More complex character development process

## 2025-07-22: Configuration-Driven Character System

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Solo Developer, Product Owner

### Decision

Implement JSON-based character configuration system with detailed personality schemas, enabling non-technical character creation and modification while maintaining consistency.

### Context

Hard-coded character personalities would require developer intervention for any changes. The demo needs to showcase how easily new characters can be created and how personality traits can be fine-tuned based on performance data.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Hard-Coded Character Classes**
   - Pros: Type safety, IDE support, compile-time validation
   - Cons: Requires developer for changes, not demo-friendly

2. **Database-Driven Configuration**
   - Pros: Runtime updates, user interface potential
   - Cons: Over-engineering for current needs, deployment complexity

### Rationale

JSON configuration provides:
- Easy character modification without code changes
- Clear demonstration of system flexibility
- Foundation for future character builder interface
- Version control for character personalities
- Schema validation for consistency

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid character iteration and testing
- Clear demonstration of system flexibility
- Non-technical character modification capability
- Foundation for future self-service character creation

**Negative:**
- Runtime validation required instead of compile-time
- Potential for configuration errors
- More complex character loading logic
